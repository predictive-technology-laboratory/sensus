# Adaptive Sensing
An essential trade off within all mobile sensing apps is between (a) data density (high sampling
rates) and continuity (no data gaps) and (b) battery drain. It is easy to configure Sensus to 
optimize either of these objectives in isolation, but striking a balance between them poses significant 
challenges. For example, one might wish to sample high-density accelerometry when the device
is likely to be used in particular ways (e.g., while walking). Similarly, one might wish to sample light 
and temperature data, but only in particular geographic locations. No single, static sensing configuration 
would satisfy such objectives while also having minimal impact on the battery. Such use cases require
dynamic sensing configurations that adapt to usage contexts.

## Adaptive Control
The figure below depicts concepts that drive adaptive sensing within Sensus.

The following concepts are indicated:

* Sensing agent:  An entity that controls sensing parameters (e.g., sampling rates and continuity) on
the basis of observed state (i.e., <xref:Sensus.Datum> objects).

* Opportunistic observation:  Sensing agents can be configured to observe state information actively 
or opportunistically. Opportunistic observation captures any <xref:Sensus.Datum> object generated 
by Sensus during normal operation. In this mode, the app will not take any extra actions to observe 
data. This has the effect of minimizing battery drain at the expense of weaker state estimates and 
sensing control.

* Opportunistic control:  In response to opportunistically observed data, the sensing agent
may decide to control sensing in a particular way (e.g., by enabling continuous sensing or
increasing sampling rates). Such decisions are only possible upon the arrival of opportunistic data.

* Action interval:  In contrast with opportunistic sensing, sensing agents can be configured to actively
seek out data. This has the effect of strengthening state estimates and sensing control at the expense 
of increased battery drain. The action interval indicates how frequently Sensus should actively observe 
data for state estimation.

* Active observation duration:  Once the action interval elapses, Sensus will begin to actively
observe each <xref:Sensus.Datum> generated by the app. This parameter governs how long active
observation should continue before checking the control criterion.

* Control criterion:  Regardless of whether Sensus is observing opportunistically or actively, 
the control criterion defines state estimates that trigger sensing control. For example, a 
criterion might specify that sensing control should occur when the average acceleration 
magnitude exceeds a critical threshold. This is demonstrated in the 
[example](https://github.com/predictive-technology-laboratory/sensus/blob/develop/ExampleSensingAgent.Shared/ExampleAccelerationSensingAgent.cs)
sensing agent. This agent also demonstrates a control criterion based on proximity of the phone
to a surface (e.g., face).

* Control completion check interval:  Once sensing control is invoked, the app will periodically 
recheck the control criterion to determine whether it is still met. If the criterion is not met, 
then sensing control ends, the sensing agent transitions sensing settings as needed (e.g., reducing
sampling rates), and the sensing agent returns to its idle state. If the criterion is still met, 
then sensing control continues unabated until the next completion check occurs. This parameter governs 
how long Sensus should wait between each completion check.

Sensus supports two mechanisms for incorporating sensing agents into a study. The first involves
writing software (in C#) to define the sensing agent. The second involves defining the agent
in a JSON-based specification language. The following sections provide more information about these
two alternatives.

## Software-Defined Sensing Agents

### Android
On Android, Sensus supports a plug-in architecture for software-defined sensing agents.
This architecture is intended to support research into adaptive sensing by providing a simple interface
through which researchers can deploy agents that implement specific adaptation approaches. Follow the 
steps below to implement and deploy an Android sensing agent.

1. Create a new Android Class Library project in Visual Studio. In Visual Studio for Mac, the following image
shows the correct selection:

![image](/sensus/images/survey-agent-project.png)

1. Add a NuGet reference to [the Sensus package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sensus).

1. Add a new class that inherits from <xref:Sensus.Adaptation.SensingAgent>. Be sure to provide a parameterless constructor
for your class, as this constructor will be called at run time to create your agent. Your class will be required
to override a few methods related to sensing control. These methods are where your sensing agent should execute its control 
policy. The <xref:Sensus.Adaptation.SensingAgent> class provides a set of predefined control criterion functions 
[here](https://github.com/predictive-technology-laboratory/sensus/blob/develop/Sensus.Shared.NuGet/Adaptation/SensingAgentControlCriteria.cs).
You can call these diretly from your code or write your own functions to suit your adaptation requirements.

1. Build the library project, and upload the resulting .dll to a web-accessible URL. A convenient
solution is to upload the .dll to a Dropbox directory and copy the sharing URL for the .dll file.

1. Generate a QR code that points to your .dll (e.g., using [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)).
The content of the QR code must be exactly as shown below:
```plain
sensing-agent:URL
```
where URL is the web-accessible URL that points to your .dll file. If you are using Dropbox, then the QR code
content will be similar to the one shown below (note the `dl=1` ending of the URL, and note that the following 
URL is only an example -- it is not actually valid):
```plain
sensing-agent:https://www.dropbox.com/s/dlaksdjfasfasdf/SensingAgent.dll?dl=1
```

1. In your <xref:Sensus.Protocol> settings, tap "Set Agent" and scan your QR code. Sensus will fetch your .dll file and 
extract any agent definitions contained therein. Select your desired agent.

1. Continue with [configuration](xref:protocol_creation) and [distribution](xref:protocol_distribution)
of your protocol. When run, your protocol will invoke the selected sensing agent according to the state diagram shown
above.

See the following implementation for an example:

* [Acceleration](xref:ExampleSensingAgent.ExampleAccelerationSensingAgent) (code [here](https://github.com/predictive-technology-laboratory/sensus/blob/develop/ExampleSensingAgent.Shared/ExampleAccelerationSensingAgent.cs)):  A 
sensing agent that samples continuously if the device is moving or near a surface (e.g., face).

### iOS
In contrast with Android, iOS does not allow apps to load code (e.g., from the above .dll assembly) at
run time. Thus, software-defined adaptive sensing agents are more limited on iOS compared with Android. Here 
are the options:

* The app comes with one 
[example](xref:ExampleSensingAgent.ExampleAccelerationSensingAgent) sensing agent (code 
[here](https://github.com/predictive-technology-laboratory/sensus/blob/develop/ExampleSensingAgent.Shared/ExampleAccelerationSensingAgent.cs)); 
however, this is simply for demonstration and is unlikely to work well in practice. Nonetheless, you 
can select this agent when configuring the <xref:Sensus.Protocol>.

* You can [redeploy](xref:redeploying) Sensus as your own app, to which you can add your own agent implementations.

* You can implement your own agent implementations following the instructions above for Android and email 
our team (uva.ptl@gmail.com) to include your implementation in a future release of the iOS app.

## Adaptive Sensing Policy Language (ASPL) Defined Sensing Agents
In addition to the software-defined adaptive sensing agents described above, Sensus supports the definition
of sensing agents in a general-purpose adaptive sensing policy language (ASPL). ASPL specifies both the 
control criteria as well as the control actions depicted in the above state diagram. The 
[example ASPL policy file](https://github.com/predictive-technology-laboratory/sensus/blob/develop/Sensus.Shared/Adaptation/example-aspl-policy.json)
demonstrates the ASPL format. The elements of the format are described in the documentation for 
<xref:Sensus.Adaptation.AsplSensingAgent>. If more than 1 <xref:Sensus.Adaptation.AsplStatement> is 
provided to the <xref:Sensus.Adaptation.AsplSensingAgent>, then the first one whose criterion is satisfied 
by the observed data will be used for sensing control.

## Softare- Versus ASPL-Defined Sensing Agents
There are pros and cons of software- and ASPL-defined sensing agents:

* Software-Defined
  * Pros:  Sophistication of control criteria. Actions are not limited to the logical structure of ASPL. Any 
  criterion that can be implemented in C# would be feasible.
  * Cons:  Low-level programming is required. Third-party deployment of iOS agents is complicated
  by iOS's prohibition of run-time code loading (see above). Changing the agent definition (whether on Android
  or iOS) involves modifying code and, for iOS, redeploying the application.
  
* ASPL-Defined
  * Pros:  Agent definitions use the relatively simple ASPL syntax. Agent definitions can be loaded at run-time 
  into both Android and iOS without the need for code changes or app redeployment.
  * Cons:  ASPL has limited logical expressiveness.
  
## Distributing Sensing Agent Policies
Regardless of whether a software- or ASPL-defined sensing agent is used, a policy must be provided to the
agent, specifying the agent's control parameters. This can be done in two ways:

* Set within protocol:  In the protocol settings, tap "Set Agent Policy", then select your JSON policy file. This 
works well to set the initial policy used by the sensing agent; however, this is not a very effective means of 
providing updated sensing policies to users during an ongoing study. Updating the policy would require the study
administrator to edit the protocol and distribute the new protocol to all users (e.g., via email), who would then 
need to manually update their protocols.

* Send via push notification:  Request a 
[push notification update](https://github.com/predictive-technology-laboratory/sensus/blob/develop/Scripts/ConfigureAWS/ec2-push-notifications/example-requests.json)
with the `type` set to <xref:Sensus.Notifications.PushNotificationUpdateType.SensingAgentPolicy> and `content` set to the 
policy you wish to provide. Sensus will parse the `content` into a JSON object and pass the resulting object to your
agent via <xref:Sensus.Adaptation.SensingAgent.SetPolicyAsync>. This is an effective option for updating the sensing 
agent's policy during ongoing studies, as users will not need to do anything in order to receive the updated policies.

## Testing and Debugging
Regardless of whether your sensing agent targets Android or iOS, there are a few ways to test and debug it:

* Monitor the agent state:  Within your <xref:Sensus.Protocol> settings, tap "View Agent State" to see a real-time
display of your agent's state. You will see it cycle through the state diagram shown above.

* Write to the log file:  See the code for the example agents above. You will see calls that write to the log file. Use similar
calls in your code to write information about the behavior of your agent to the log. Run your agent for a while in the app and
then share the log file with yourself from within the app. Note that the size of the log file is limited, so you might not be 
able to view the entire log history of your agent.

* Flash notifications on the screen:  On Android, you can flash notifications on the screen as shown in the example code. These
messages will appear for a short duration.

* Run your agent in the debugger:  By far the most useful approach is to [configure a development system](xref:dev_config) and
run Sensus in the debugger with your sensing agent. You will need to add your agent code to the Sensus app projects in order to 
step through it in the debugger.

## Data Streams
In addition to directly impacting the data streams that are collected (e.g., via sampling rates and enabling/disabling
[probes](<xref:Sensus.Probes.Probe)), the use of a sensing agent will cause additional data to be written to the 
[local data store](xref:Sensus.DataStores.Local.LocalDataStore). These include:

* Datum-level tagging:  Each <xref:Sensus.Datum> collected by the app will be tagged with a description of the sensing 
agent's state at the time when the <xref:Sensus.Datum> was collected. This is achieved by setting 
<xref:Sensus.Datum.SensingAgentStateDescription> to the value of <xref:Sensus.Adaptation.SensingAgent.StateDescription>.

* Sensing agent lifecycle:  Each time the sensing agent transitions from one state to another, a 
<xref:Sensus.Adaptation.SensingAgentStateDatum> will be written to the 
[local data store](xref:Sensus.DataStores.Local.LocalDataStore) to record the transition. This will be done regardless 
of whether any other <xref:Sensus.Datum> readings are collected.
