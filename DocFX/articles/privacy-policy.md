# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

Immediately following installation, Sensus will not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from the 
device on which it is running. Sensus will upload reports when the app crashes. These reports contain information 
about the state of the app when it crashed, and Sensus developers will use these crash reports to improve Sensus. 
These reports do not contain any personal information. After you load a study into Sensus, Sensus will begin collecting 
data as defined by the study. You will be notified when the study is loaded and is about to start, and you will be 
asked to confirm that you wish to start the study. This confirmation will summarize the types of data to be collected. 
You may quit a study and/or uninstall Sensus at any time. Be aware that Sensus is publicly available and that anyone 
can use Sensus to design a study, which they can then share with others. Studies have the ability to collect personal 
information, and you should exercise caution when loading any study that you receive.

## Data Use

process, which limit use of all data to the specific purposes of the study. All data are used in aggregated analyses to protect 
the privacy of participants.

## Data Sharing

Data collected in studies run by the University of Virginia are not shared in any manner whatsoever with any third parties.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Data collected in studies run by the University of Virginia are retained according to the policies set forth during
the consent process, which normally require retention for the duration of the study. You may email the study coordinator 
at any time to request deletion of your data. To do this, tap the study within Sensus and select the email option.
