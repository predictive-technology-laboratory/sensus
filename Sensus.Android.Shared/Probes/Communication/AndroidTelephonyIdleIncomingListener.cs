	/// from outgoing calls on the basis of <see cref="CallState"/> values, we also need the <see cref="AndroidTelephonyOutgoingBroadcastReceiver"/>.
	/// The difficulty is caused by the fact that an incoming call will transition to <see cref="CallState.Ringing"/> and then immediately to
	/// <see cref="CallState.Offhook"/>, whereas an outgoing call will transition directly to <see cref="CallState.Offhook"/>. We'd rather not have to interpret 
	/// <see cref="CallState.Offhook"/> differently depending on what the previous state was and how recently it was observed.
