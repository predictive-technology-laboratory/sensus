be only a few KBs.

Use the following request format to deliver updates of arbitrary size to a 
device. Note that each update must identify a protocol to which the update 
should be delivered. This format does not permit a title, body, or sound. See
the documentation for Sensus.Notifications.PushNotificationUpdate.
